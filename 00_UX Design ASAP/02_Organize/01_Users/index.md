### Personas

Persona is a *fictional character* constructed to represent the needs of a whole range (a segment) of real users. It is an archetype of a user segment, explained and detailed.

To create personas, we need to *collect information* in order to generate a character. It's important to give a name to this character, adding a face to a segment of users that represent some concrete needs we need to keep in mind during the design process. 

All the information you collected previously on the discovery phase (research + segmentation), is the information you need to analyze in order to understand who are your key personas.

*Creating personas*
To create personas add all the necessary information as… age, occupation, personal situation, knowledge, technological knowledge and habits, If they use the web/internet from home, work, usual tasks they do on the net, Motivations to buy/use, Advantage they get using the service, etc. 

* *Primary personas* are those who need a unique interaction model that it is only appropiate for them. They have more needs than the secondary personas. They could represent a smaller group of users (even if they are primary, just because we only focus on needs). 

* *Secondary personas* are those who could use the web created for some other personas.

In case we found more than three personas, the webpage will be difficult to create.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Unlike marketing, UX personas are based on qualitative data (user needs) instead of quantitative data.



*Scenarios*

Scenario is the context where “personas” we created act. It is about putting personas in action. A description of the persona on a concrete situation using the web/interface, with a defined objective.

Appreciations: 
    * Those scenarios will be created based on the previous user interview and observations.
    * It’s really important to forget our previous knowledge.
    * We need to represent... Needs, Knowledge and Objectives


Scenario typologies:

*High frequency actions*
They are the most used actions. They require certain pedagogy on first use experience, but they will stop being necessary because of their high frequency. As soon as they are used, users will start using shortcuts to get to their objectives. I.e: Navigation menu or a product category

*Necessary actions*
They are the necessary actions to complete the objective. Not really frequent but extremely important. They need to be really easy to use due to their importance. i.e: shopping cart steps

*Marginal actions*
They are not used really much. They could be almost ignored.
Spend time on them could be a waste of time but this doe not mean that they should be deleted but they have a secondary place. i.e: FAQs, contact info, etc.
