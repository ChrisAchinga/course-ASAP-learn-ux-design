### What is UX

UX is the way a user understands feels and uses a system, device or service plus the sensations, perceptions or results obtained from it. What you get from it.

It is composed by a variety of disciplines that affect the resultant experience of the product, interface or service designed.

Each project will need different skills, as UX covers a large variety of areas, but usually we are used working in UX with teams of Concept Designer, Information Architect, Interaction Designer and Visual Designers. Those roles could be mixed based on the skills of each team member.

*Note* 
UX and UI are not the same thing. They are related but UI is part of the other (UX) as it belongs to the UX design process. While UI refers merely to designing a User interface, UX refers to designing the experience users will have when using it.
