### Usability

Usability is the clarity and ease of learnability and usage of a interface (or product). 
It also includes the study of the the interaction with a computer, program or a web site. 

Usability considers user satisfaction and utility as quality components, and aims to improve user experience through iteration design. 

Jakob Nielsen defines usability it as a quality attribute that assesses on how easy user interfaces can be used. The word "usability" also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process. 

He expresses that Usability is defined by 5 quality components:
    * Learnability: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?
    * Efficiency: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
    * Memorability: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?
    * Errors: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?
    * Satisfaction: How pleasant is it to use the design?

Usability  should be treated on every page or piece of interface, but specially on those parts where users need to take actions or interact with complex situations (e.g. buying something).

Interface usability is directly related to usage time and productivity. If a interface is not easy to use, read or understand, users will stop using it. 

To achieve those objectives is important to understand user needs and objectives in order to design effective interactions and interfaces. To that end, please review the… User research section on Discover phase.

It is important to understand that Usability is directly related to interaction design.
